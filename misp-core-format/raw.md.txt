Abstract

   This document describes the MISP core format used to exchange
   indicators and threat information between MISP (Malware Information
   and threat Sharing Platform) instances.  The JSON format includes the
   overall structure along with the semantic associated for each
   respective key.  The format is described to support other
   implementations which reuse the format and ensuring an
   interoperability with existing MISP [MISP-P] software and other
   Threat Intelligence Platforms.

1.  Introduction

   Sharing threat information became a fundamental requirements in the
   Internet, security and intelligence community at large.  Threat
   information can include indicators of compromise, malicious file
   indicators, financial fraud indicators or even detailed information
   about a threat actor.  MISP started as an open source project in late
   2011 and the MISP format started to be widely used as an exchange
   format within the community in the past years.  The aim of this
   document is to describe the specification and the MISP core format.

2.  Format

2.1.  Overview

   The MISP core format is in the JSON [RFC4627] format.  In MISP, an
   event is composed of a single JSON object.

2.2.  Event

   An event is a simple meta structure scheme where attributes and meta-
   data are embedded to compose a coherent set of indicators.  An event
   can be composed from an incident, a security analysis report or a
   specific threat actor analysis.  The meaning of an event only depends
   of the information embedded in the event.
