                    draft-dulaunoy-misp-core-format

Abstract

   This document describes the MISP core format used to exchange
   indicators and threat information between MISP (Malware Information
   and threat Sharing Platform) instances.  The JSON format includes the
   overall structure along with the semantic associated for each
   respective key.  The format is described to support other
   implementations which reuse the format and ensuring an
   interoperability with existing MISP [MISP-P] software and other
   Threat Intelligence Platforms.

1.  Introduction

   Sharing threat information became a fundamental requirements in the
   Internet, security and intelligence community at large.  Threat
   information can include indicators of compromise, malicious file
   indicators, financial fraud indicators or even detailed information
   about a threat actor.  MISP started as an open source project in late
   2011 and the MISP format started to be widely used as an exchange
   format within the community in the past years.  The aim of this
   document is to describe the specification and the MISP core format.

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Format

2.1.  Overview

   The MISP core format is in the JSON [RFC4627] format.  In MISP, an
   event is composed of a single JSON object.

   A capitalized key (like Event, Org) represent a data model and a non-
   capitalized key is just an attribute.  This nomenclature can support
   an implementation to represent the MISP format in another data
   structure.

2.2.  Event

   An event is a simple meta structure scheme where attributes and meta-
   data are embedded to compose a coherent set of indicators.  An event
   can be composed from an incident, a security analysis report or a
   specific threat actor analysis.  The meaning of an event only depends
   of the information embedded in the event.

2.2.1.  Event Attributes

2.2.1.1.  uuid

   uuid represents the Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) [RFC4122] of
   the event.  The uuid MUST be preserved for any updates or transfer of
   the same event.  UUID version 4 is RECOMMENDED when assigning it to a
   new event.

   uuid is represented as a JSON string. uuid MUST be present.

2.2.1.2.  id

   id represents the human-readable identifier associated to the event
   for a specific MISP instance.

   id is represented as a JSON string. id SHALL be present.

2.2.1.3.  published

   published represents the event publication state.  If the event was
   published, the published value MUST be true.  In any other
   publication state, the published value MUST be false.

   published is represented as a JSON boolean. published MUST be
   present.

2.2.1.4.  info

   info represents the information field of the event. info a free-text
   value to provide a human-readable summary of the event. info SHOULD
   NOT be bigger than 256 characters.

   info is represented as a JSON string. info MUST be present.

2.2.1.5.  threat_level_id

   threat_level_id represents the threat level.

      Undefined

   1:
      Low

   2:
      Medium

   3:
      High

   If a higher granularity is required, a MISP taxonomy applied as a Tag
   SHOULD be preferred.

   threat_level_id is represented as a JSON string. threat_level_id
   SHALL be present.

2.2.1.6.  date

   date represents a reference date to the event in ISO 8601 format
   (date only: YYYY-MM-DD).  This date corresponds to the date the event
   occured, which may be in the past.

   date is represented as a JSON string.

2.2.1.7.  timestamp

   timestamp represents a reference time when the event, or one of the 
   attributes within the event was created, or last updated/edited 
   on the instance. timestamp is expressed in seconds (decimal) since 
   1st of January 1970 (Unix timestamp). The time zone MUST be UTC.

   timestamp is represented as a JSON string. timestamp MUST be present.

2.2.1.8.  publish_timestamp

   publish_timestamp represents a reference time when the event was
   published on the instance. published_timestamp is expressed in
   seconds (decimal) since 1st of January 1970 (Unix timestamp).  At
   each publication of an event, publish_timestamp MUST be updated.  The
   time zone MUST be UTC.

   publish_timestamp is represented as a JSON string. publish_timestamp
   MUST be present.

2.2.1.9.  org_id

   org_id represents the Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) [RFC4122]
   of the organization which generated the event.  The org_id MUST be
   updated when the event is generated by a new instance.

   org_id is represented as a JSON string. org_id MUST be present.

2.2.1.10.  orgc_id

   orgc_id represents the Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) [RFC4122]
   of the organization which created the event.  The orgc_id MUST be
   preserved for any updates or transfer of the same event.  UUID
   version 4 is RECOMMENDED when assigning it to a new event.  orgc_id
   is globally assigned to an organization and SHALL be kept overtime.

   orgc_id is represented as a JSON string. orgc_id MUST be present.

2.2.1.11.  attribute_count

   attribute_count represents the number of attributes in the event.
