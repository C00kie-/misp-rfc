                    draft-dulaunoy-misp-core-format

Abstract

   This document describes the MISP core format used to exchange
   indicators and threat information between MISP (Malware Information
   and threat Sharing Platform) instances.  The JSON format includes the
   overall structure along with the semantic associated for each
   respective key.  The format is described to support other
   implementations which reuse the format and ensuring an
   interoperability with existing MISP [MISP-P] software and other
   Threat Intelligence Platforms.

1.  Introduction

   Sharing threat information became a fundamental requirements in the
   Internet, security and intelligence community at large.  Threat
   information can include indicators of compromise, malicious file
   indicators, financial fraud indicators or even detailed information
   about a threat actor.  MISP [MISP-P] started as an open source
   project in late 2011 and the MISP format started to be widely used as
   an exchange format within the community in the past years.  The aim
   of this document is to describe the specification and the MISP core
   format.

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Format

2.1.  Overview

   The MISP core format is in the JSON [RFC4627] format.  In MISP, an
   event is composed of a single JSON object.

   A capitalized key (like Event, Org) represent a data model and a non-
   capitalized key is just an attribute.  This nomenclature can support
   an implementation to represent the MISP format in another data
   structure.

2.2.  Event

   An event is a simple meta structure scheme where attributes and meta-
   data are embedded to compose a coherent set of indicators.  An event
   can be composed from an incident, a security analysis report or a
   specific threat actor analysis.  The meaning of an event only depends
   of the information embedded in the event.

2.2.1.  Event Attributes

2.2.1.1.  uuid

   uuid represents the Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) [RFC4122] of
   the event.  The uuid MUST be preserved for any updates or transfer of
   the same event.  UUID version 4 is RECOMMENDED when assigning it to a
   new event.

   uuid is represented as a JSON string. uuid MUST be present.

2.2.1.2.  id

   id represents the human-readable identifier associated to the event
   for a specific MISP instance.

   id is represented as a JSON string. id SHALL be present.

2.2.1.3.  published

   published represents the event publication state.  If the event was
   published, the published value MUST be true.  In any other
   publication state, the published value MUST be false.

   published is represented as a JSON boolean. published MUST be
   present.

   If a higher granularity is required, a MISP taxonomy applied as a Tag
   SHOULD be preferred.

   threat_level_id is represented as a JSON string. threat_level_id
   SHALL be present.

2.2.1.6.  analysis

   analysis represents the analysis level.

   0:
      Initial

2.2.1.13.  distribution

   distribution represents the basic distribution rules of the event.
   The system must adhere to the distribution setting for access control
   and for dissemination of the event.

   present and be one of the following options:

   0
      Your Organisation Only

   1
      This Community Only

2.3.1.  Org

   An Org object is composed of an uuid, name and id.

   other instances of a revocation.

   deleted is represented by a JSON boolean. deleted MUST be present.

2.4.2.12.  RelatedAttribute

   RelatedAttribute is an array of attributes correlating with the
   current attribute.  Each element in the array represents an JSON
   object which contains an Attribute dictionnary with the external
   attributes correlating.  Each Attribute MUST include the id, org_id,
   info and a value.  Only the correlations found on the local instance
   are shown in RelatedAttribute.

2.4.2.13.  value

   value represents the payload of an attribute.  The format of the
   value is dependent on the type of the attribute.

   value is represented by a JSON string. value MUST be present.

2.5.  Tag

   A Tag is a simple method to classify an event with a simple tag name.
   The tag name can be freely chosen.  The tag name can be also chosen
   from a fixed machine-tag vocabulary called MISP taxonomies[[MISP-T]].
   A Tag is represented as a JSON array where each element describes
   each tag associated.  A Tag array SHALL be, at least, at Event level.

   A tag element is described with a name, id, colour and exportable
   flag.

   exportable represents a setting if the tag is kept local or
   exportable to other MISP instances. exportable is represented by a
   JSON boolean. id is a human-readable identifier that references the
   tag on the local instance. colour represents an RGB value of the tag.

   name MUST be present. colour, id and exportable SHALL be present.

2.5.1.  Sample Tag

                       "Tag": [{
                               "exportable": true,
                               "colour": "#ffffff",
                               "name": "tlp:white",
                               "id": "2" }]

3.  Manifest

   MISP events can be shared over an HTTP repository, a file package or
   USB key.  A manifest file is used to provide an index of MISP events
   allowing to only fetch the recently updated files without the need to
   parse each json file.

3.1.  Format

   A manifest file is a simple JSON file named manifest.json in a
   directory where the MISP events are located.  Each MISP event is a
   file located in the same directory with the event uuid as filename
   with the json extension.

   The manifest format is a JSON object composed of a dictionary where
   the field is the uuid of the event.

   Each uuid is composed of a JSON object with the following fields
   which came from the original event referenced by the same uuid:

   o  info (MUST)

   o  Orgc object (MUST)

   o  analysis (SHALL)

   o  timestamp (MUST)

   o  date (MUST)

   o  threat_level_id (SHALL)

   In addition to the fields originating from the event, the following
   fields can be added:

   o  integrity:sha256 represents the SHA256 value in hexadecimal
      representation of the associated MISP event file to ensure
      integrity of the file.  (SHOULD)

   o  integrity:pgp represents a detached PGP signature [RFC4880] of the
      associated MISP event file to ensure integrity of the file.
      (SHOULD)

   If a detached PGP signature is used for each MISP event, a detached
   PGP signature is a MUST to ensure integrity of the manifest file.  A
   detached PGP signature for a manifest file is a manifest.json.pgp
   file containing the PGP signature.

4.  Security Considerations

   MISP events might contain sensitive or confidential information.
   Adequate access control and encryption measures shall be implemented
   to ensure the confidentiality of the MISP events.

   Adversaries might include malicious content in MISP events and
   attributes.  Implementation MUST consider the input of malicious
   inputs beside the standard threat information that might already
   include malicious intended inputs.

5.  Acknowledgements

   The authors wish to thank all the MISP community to support the
   creation of open standards in threat intelligence sharing.
