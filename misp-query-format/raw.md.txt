                           MISP query format
                    draft-dulaunoy-misp-core-format

Abstract

   This document describes the MISP query format used to search MISP
   (Malware Information and threat Sharing Platform) [MISP-P] threat
   intelligence instances.  MISP query format is a simple format used to
   query MISP instances over a REST (Representational State Transfer )
   interface.  The query format includes the JSON format to describe the
   query and the minimal API access to perform the query.  The JSON
   format includes the overall structure along with the semantic
   associated for each respective key.  The goal of the format is to
   query MISP threat intelligence instances can feed and integrate with
   network security devices (such as firewall, network intrusion
   detection system, routers, SIEMs), endpoint security devices or
   monitoring devices.

1.  Introduction

   Sharing threat information became a fundamental requirements in the
   Internet, security and intelligence community at large.  Threat
   information can include indicators of compromise, malicious file
   indicators, financial fraud indicators or even detailed information
   about a threat actor.  MISP [MISP-P] started as an open source
   project in late 2011 and the MISP format started to be widely used as
   an exchange format within the community in the past years.  The core
   format is described in an Internet-Draft as misp-core-format [MISP-C]
   and contain the standard MISP JSON format used for threat
   intelligence.

   The aim of this document is to describe the specification of the MISP
   query format and how the query can be perform against a REST
   interface.

Internet-Draft              MISP query format               October 2018


1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Format

2.1.  Overview

   The MISP query format is in the JSON [RFC4627] format.

2.2.  query format criteria

2.2.1.  returnFormat

   returnFormat MUST be present. returnFormat sets the type of output
   format.  MISP allows multiple format (depending of the
   configuration):

       +----------+------------------------------------------------+
       |  value   |                  Description                   |
       +----------+------------------------------------------------+
       |   json   | MISP JSON core format as described in [MISP-C] |
       |   xml    |                MISP XML format                 |
       | openioc  |                 OpenIOC format                 |
       | suricata |              Suricata NIDS format              |
       |  snort   |               Snort NIDS format                |
       |   csv    |                   CSV format                   |
       |   rpz    |          Response policy zone format           |
       |   text   |             Raw value list format              |
       +----------+------------------------------------------------+

2.2.2.  limit

   limit MAY be present.  If present, the page parameter MUST also be
   supplied. limit sets the number of returned elements when paginating,
   depending on the scope of the request (x number of attributes or x
   number of events) as converted into the output format.

2.2.3.  page

   page MAY be present.  If present, the page parameter MUST also be
   supplied. page generates the offset for the pagination and will
   return a result set consisting of a slice of the query results
   starting with offset (limit * page) + 1 and ending with (limit *
   (page+1)).

2.2.4.  value

   value MAY be present.  If set, the returned data set will be filtered
   on the attribute value field. value MAY be a string or a sub-string,
   the latter of which start with, ends with or is encapsulated in
   wildcard (\%) characters.

2.2.5.  type

   type MAY be present.  If set, the returned data set will be filtered
   on the attribute type field. type MAY be a string or a sub-string,
   the latter of which start with, ends with or is encapsulated in
   wildcard (\%) characters.  The list of valid attribute types is
   described in the MISP core format [MISP-C] in the attribute type
   section.

2.2.6.  category

   category MAY be present.  If set, the returned data set will be
   filtered on the attribute category field. category MAY be a string or
   a sub-string, the latter of which start with, ends with or is
   encapsulated in wildcard (\%) characters.  The list of valid
   categories is described in the MISP core format [MISP-C] in the
   attribute type section.

   A sample query to lookup for the last 30 days of indicators in the
   "Financial fraud" category and output in CSV format:

                     {
                         "returnFormat": "csv",
                         "last": "30d",
                         "category": "Financial fraud"
                     }

3.  Security Considerations

   MISP threat intelligence instances might contain sensitive or
   confidential information.  Adequate access control and encryption
   measures shall be implemented to ensure the confidentiality of the
   threat intelligence.

   Adversaries might include malicious content in MISP queries.
   Implementation MUST consider the input of malicious inputs beside the
   standard threat information that might already include malicious
   intended inputs.

4.  Acknowledgements

   The authors wish to thank all the MISP community who are supporting
   the creation of open standards in threat intelligence sharing.  A
   special thank to all the committees which triggered us to come with
   better and flexible format.
