                Recommendations on naming threat actors

Abstract

   This document provides advice on the naming of threat actors (also
   known as malicious actors).  The objective is to provide practical
   advices for organisations such as security vendors or organisations
   attributing incidents to a group of threat actor.  It also discusses
   the implication of naming a threat actor towards intelligence
   analysts and threat intelligence platforms such as MISP [MISP-P]].

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.  Recommendations

2.1.  Reusing threat actor naming

   Before creating a new threat actor name, you MUST consider a review
   of existing threat actor names from databases such as the threat
   actor MISP galaxy [MISP-G].  Proliferation of threat actor names is a
   significant challenge for the day-to-day analyst work.  If your
   threat actor defined an existing threat actor, you MUST reuse an
   existing threat actor name.  If there is no specific threat actor
   name, you SHALL create a new threat actor following the best
   practices defined in this document.

2.2.  Don't confuse actor naming with malware naming

2.3.  Format

2.4.  Encoding

2.5.  Directory

3.  Examples

4.  Security Considerations

   Naming a threat actor could include specific sensitive reference to a
   case or an incident.  Before releasing the naming, the creator MUST
   review the name to ensure no sensitive information is included in the
   threat actor name.
